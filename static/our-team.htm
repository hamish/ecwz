                        children. This first hand experience gave me the insight and understanding
                        to pursue establishing this NGO as I believe I can make a difference. Despite
                        initial laughter and skepticism at my ideas both Nepali’s and foreigners are
                        now receptive and support me from a wide range of angles and therefore I am
                        enjoying the greatest virtue of the human world through my work. I know that the
                        norm at my age is to pursue money and career but only such things cannot give
                        us satisfaction and happiness in life. I am happy, satisfied and can feel pride in

                        small or important they feel it is. We should all feel the joy of giving.</td>

                        for me to find my niche in the world. This journey changed my life and I returned
                        to Australia, sold all my belongings, diligently saved, fundraised and returned
                        to Nepal in order to live my dream of succouring. I can now say with pride that
                        I don’t owe or own anything. My freedom is my most treasured gift and as a result,
                        I am free to give to others. For the first time, I can foresee my future with a
                        calm confidence. I am most completely satisfied with the work I do in Nepal and
                        the team I work with and am therefore content. Albert Camus, the French writer,
