        <h3>Bishnu Lamichhane</h3>
        <p>Bishnu Lamichhane, 19 from Dhaibung-9, Rasuwa now visits forests and fields for the study and research in the field of forestry science. He was in 8th Grade when we started supporting him. Our small support not only supported him by arranging stationery supplies but motivated him to do best in his academic career. After completing his secondary level education in 2008, he went to a forestry science college for the admission. His parents could not afford for his education. However we went to Hetauda; the city around 450 km far from his home for the entrance test where he got full scholarship being 5th in the rank among more than a thousand candidates.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Zhenda Tavkar and family, well wishers of ECWZ, from Slovenia for being so special bringing so many positive changes in the life of this poor boy. Now he is about to complete first two years course (Technical Certificate Level). After the completion of Bachelor in Science, he wants to work for the environment sector.</p>
