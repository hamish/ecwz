            <h2>Sponsorship Project</h2>

            <div class="block"><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

            <img class="photo inline"  src="../images/Project1.jpg" alt="" />

            <h3>Aim</h3>
	    <p>Every village within the district has people who are role models for the rest of the village who establish village trends. Each trend happens because a leading personality in each village achieves greatness in the eye of their neighbour – usually by earning money as a result of their actions. The other villagers then follow suit, following in the footsteps of these leaders. Our aim is to provide an alternative future for village youth through the establishment of an educational based trend.</p>

            <h3>Project location</h3>
	    <p>Nepal comprises of five regions. We will initially focus on the Central Region and in particular the Rasuwa District which lies on the Chinese border 90kms north of Kathmandu. The population of Rasuwa is nearly 50000 and the population density is 32people/km2. Rasuwa has many ethnic groups of people. More than 80% are from Mongolian communities while the rest are from groups such as Brahmins, Chetris, Damai, Kami etc. The district has 18 Village Development Committees (VDC) and every VDC has 9 wards. The targeted workplace for this project involves 5 VDCs’ called Dhaibung, Bhorle, Laharepauwa, Yarsa and Saramthali. The villages are selected on a priority basis. These districts have a low standard of living due to a combination of factors including infertile land and lack of education. The majority of these people live below the poverty line without enough to eat for themselves and their families because there are fewer opportunities to obtain economical stability. </p>

            <h3>Timeframe</h3>
	    <p>5 years (From April 2006 to April 2011). Project repeated due to success.</p>

            <h3>Target group</h3>
	    <p>Children studying above Five Class from remote areas and from the marginalized groups.</p>

            <h3>How you can support us</h3>
	    <p>Volunteers (teachers, health workers), sponsorship, donations.</p>

            <h3>Sponsorship renewals</h3>
	    <p>Due
March each year. You can <a href="http://www.ecwz.org.np/donation.htm">make
an online donation or sponsorship</a> at any time (via
PayPal). <br>Please contact <a href="mailto:iknownara@gmail.com">Nara

            <h2>Children’s library and resource center</h2>

            <p>ECWZ with the support from a charity called Ganesh-Himal.be ASBL, (Belgium) has established a Children’s Library and a resource center in Jhyanglanga village of Rasuwa. Basic infrastructure and materials have been provided for library and traditional costumes and musical instruments have been managed so children could practice their ancient culture. Basically children will have opportunity to generate fund to run the library through their traditional cultural show.</p>

            <h2>Disaster Relief</h2>
            <p>In August 2006 there was a freak and fatal landslide in one of our villages, Ghormu, and ECWZ Nepal carried out an emergency relief program. Our project intentions are primarily for child education, but when the Red Cross and other NGO’s fell short of the immediate demands of the people, we stepped in with emergency fundraising efforts by our team members. 10 people died and 84 families affected by the landslide as their homes, crops, animals and livelihood were destroyed by disaster. We distributed clothing and sufficient rice to last each family 2 months, which is when their crops will be ready to harvest for next season and the monsoon had finished. ECWZ provided 2520kg rice and has been sponsoring 12 children from Ghormu village.</p>

            <h2>Sponsorship Project</h2>
            <h3>This project is being repeated, with 100+ children sponsored annually</h3>
            <p>ECWZ Nepal has been sponsoring 75 children from most remote 15 villages of Rasuwa District since April 2006. Project area used to be the “Base Area” of Maoist during 12 years long armed conflict in the name of “People’s War”. No any organization could go and work ether and even Govt. could not go and work effectively. We started our project few months before the ceasefire, so did not get in trouble though we had to work under the direct supervision of them. Since there is peace agreement now, there is no question of security for working there. Selected villages are backward geographically, economically, educationally and from every point of view. Through our sponsorship program, we aim to increase the participation of the children at school to establish an education-based trend. We have been running this project through the support of our individual sponsors. </p>
