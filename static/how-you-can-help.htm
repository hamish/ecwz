    <h2>Sponsor a child</h2>
    <p>We
        have sponsored 75 children from different rural villages but still
        there are so many children left deserving immediate support
        including orphans, victim of natural disaster, Victim of armed

        colors? Pencils? Dolls? Clothing? Maps? Or anything, which could be
        useful for kids? Please do send to us, which will be most useful for
        poor kids in village who do not have many resources.</p>

    <h2>Sponsor Mini Projects</h2>
    <p>Do
        you wish to take a challenge sponsoring / organizing a mini project?
        Do you want to organize Quiz contest? Debate? Drawing and Artwork?
        Poetry? Picnic? Road Dramas? Documentaries? It would be a most
        promising action. Work with children and have fun.</p>


    <h2>Provide Technical Support</h2>
    <p>o you have any
        technical knowledge? Are you a filmmaker? An IT professional? Any
        what? Your technical support will be most valuable for since we can
        make our projects effective and can promote our charity. For
        example, if you are a filmmaker, Documentaries and Docu dramas are
        best tools for awareness programs.</p>
