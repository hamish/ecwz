            <h2>Literacy Program</h2>
            <p>An informal education concept where we use materials such as audio visuals and dramas to raise awareness. Time and place remain flexible for the convenience of the target group. The aim of this program is to make people aware of social issues, diseases and other problems.</p>
            <p>Some new practical programs will be conducted in remote schools with relevant tools, techniques and materials. Documentaries will be produced to make people aware of social issues, problems and diseases (such as HIV AIDS), child labour, racial discrimination etc.</p>

            <h2>Womens Empowerment</h2>
            <p>To upgrade the social status of women and increase their income level. This program will launch different programs like micro credit saving, income generating farming, skill development and adult literacy.</p>
